    "One day you decide to arrange all your cats in a giant circle. Initially, none of your cats have any hats on. You walk around the circle 100 times, always starting at the same spot, with the first cat (cat # 1). Every time you stop at a cat, you either put a hat on it if it doesn’t have one on, or you take its hat off if it has one on.\n",

    "Here you should write an algorithm, and after that, try to make pseudo code. Only after that start to work. The code is simple here, but you might struggle with the algorithm. Therefore don`t try to write a code from the first attempt. Don't forget to calculate the complexity of your algorithm."
